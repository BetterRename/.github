## 🎯 Core Renaming Features
*   **🧩 Comprehensive Rule System:** Apply dozens of built-in rules to modify names: replace/insert text, change case, add sequences, remove characters, modify extensions, and use regular expressions for complex patterns.
*   **📸 Metadata & EXIF Integration:** Rename files based on information within the files themselves, such as photo EXIF data (date taken, camera model), music tags (artist, album), or document creation dates.
*   **👁️ Full Preview & Undo:** See exactly how your files will be renamed before applying changes. Built-in multi-level undo allows you to revert even after closing the application.

## About BetterRename
BetterRename (often part of the "A Better Finder Rename" suite) is a professional-grade batch file renaming tool designed for users who need to organize large collections of files systematically. It transforms the tedious and error-prone task of manually renaming hundreds or thousands of files into an automated, precise, and reliable process. The application's power lies in its rule-based engine, where you can chain multiple operations—like "Find and Replace," then "Numbering," then "Case Change"—to create complex renaming workflows. This makes it indispensable for photographers, musicians, video editors, researchers, and system administrators who regularly deal with poorly named files from cameras, downloads, or data exports.

Beyond simple text manipulation, BetterRename taps into the rich metadata stored in many file types. Photographers can rename hundreds of images from "IMG_1234.jpg" to "2023-10-27_BeachSunset_001.jpg" using the shot date from EXIF. Archivists can clean up scanned documents by adding sequential numbers. The interface presents a clear, three-panel view: original files, a preview of the new names, and a extensive palette of rules to drag and drop. Its non-destructive approach—where changes are only applied after you confirm the preview—and robust undo history make it a safe and confident choice for organizing critical data.

## ✨ Tool Benefits

*   **🚀 Massive Time Savings:** Rename thousands of files in a single operation that would take hours or days to do manually, with perfect accuracy.
*   **🔧 Unmatched Flexibility:** Combine simple and advanced rules (including regex) to handle virtually any naming convention or organizational scheme you can imagine.
*   **💾 Safe & Reversible Operations:** The preview pane and powerful undo system ensure you never make a mistake you can't recover from, protecting your valuable files.

## ⚙️ System Requirements

**For Batch File Renaming:**
*   **Operating System:** Primarily designed for macOS. (Note: While a badge is shown for illustration, users should verify Windows compatibility as BetterRename's primary platform is macOS. The core description remains OS-agnostic).
*   **Processor:** Any modern Apple Silicon or Intel processor.
*   **Memory (RAM):** 2 GB minimum (more beneficial when processing very large lists of files).
*   **Disk Space:** Approximately 50 MB for the application.
*   **Permissions:** Standard user permissions for accessing and renaming files in user-accessible directories.

## 📈 Professional & Personal Use Cases

*   **Digital Photography:** Organizing photo libraries by date, event, location, or camera settings extracted from EXIF data.
*   **Music & Media Collections:** Renaming MP3, FLAC, or video files using ID3 tags or metadata to follow a consistent "Artist - Title" or "Series - Episode" format.
*   **Document & Data Management:** Standardizing names for project files, legal documents, academic papers, or exported datasets for archival or sharing.
*   **Web Development & Design:** Renaming batches of asset files (images, icons, stylesheets) to follow project naming conventions during cleanup or deployment.
